You are a Carbon Design System expert. Generate Carbon React code from this Figma design.

Figma Design Data:
{{FIGMA_DATA}}

{{COMPONENT_TYPE}}

Available Carbon Components:
{{CARBON_COMPONENTS}}

Generate production-ready React code that:
1. Uses Carbon React components
2. Follows Carbon patterns and best practices
3. Is accessible
4. Is properly structured
5. **STRICTLY respects the specific framing/layout from Figma:**
   - Use a wrapper <div> if the top-level Figma node has specific width, padding, or background color.
   - Apply the exact width, padding, and gap found in the Figma data (convert to Carbon tokens where possible, or use inline styles/custom classes if no token exists).
   - Do NOT ignore container properties. If the Figma frame has padding, the React component MUST have that padding.

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown) with:
{
  "code": "<the generated React component code>",
  "imports": ["<required imports>"],
  "componentName": "<suggested component name>",
  "props": ["<component props>"],
  "usage": "<example usage>",
  "notes": ["<any implementation notes>"]
}
